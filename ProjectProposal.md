### Identifying a Need
__Need:__ My game aims to build up curiosity in young children through exploration and interesting questlines such as collecting items and finding characters.\
__Problem Statement:__ Young children need engaging and fun games to develop their curiosity. A fun RPG game that lets players roam and explore a world. It also includes fun and interactive quests that children are able to complete.\
__Skill Development:__ To develop the skills needed to create this game, I will follow the Unity Learn tutorial: https://learn.unity.com/project/creator-kit-rpg?uv=2021.3

### Requirements Outline
__Inputs:__ My game will need to track keyboard inputs such as WASD or arrow keys to track character movement. It also needs to track mouse movements and clicks to identify the decisions made by the player.\
__Processing:__ My program will check for interactions between the character/player and NPCs. It will also check if characters enter/exit building and modify the background accordingly.\
__Outputs:__ The game will display character, active quests and background such as building, grass or fences. It will also display character dialogue when interacting with a character. It will also display information to the user when the character reaches a specific location.\
__Transmission:__ There will be no need for data transmission as it is just a solo RPG game.\
__Storage:__ User progress will be stored and saved locally so the user can safely quit and and log off without losing any progress.\

### Functional Requirements
__User Interaction:__ The user will intereact with the system via mouse movevments, clicking, and keyboard commands. The user will be able to move the character, pick up items, select options as well as interact with NPCs. For example, WASD will move a character around and clicking on a NPC will begin an interaction with it, whether it is displaying a quest or adding to the story.
